Our app is called Step to Learn, and it is a mobile education app for nomadic children till the primary level. It has features such as:

- An AI bot that answers doubts and guides lessons 🤖

- Three language support, including Urdu, Hindi, and English 🗣️

- Quizzes for maths, science, English, and Hindi 📝

- An event option, where they can organize and join events 🎉

- A study material option, where they can download and access materials offline 📚

- A user profile option, where they can change their name, email id, and photo 📸

- A contact us page, where they can send emails, call, or access FAQ 💬

- A video library, where they can watch videos for each standard, from 1st to 4th 📺

- A video player, where they can pause, skip, adjust volume, and see the next video 🎬


What makes Step to Learn different is that it is:


- Built using Flutter, a cross-platform framework that can run on Android, iOS, web, Windows, Linux, and macOS 💻

- Scalable, which means we can easily add new courses and content, For example, if we want to include standard 5 in our app, we only need to make changes in the backend (firebase), without affecting the front-end or the user experience 🔝

- Responsive, which means it adapts to different screen sizes 📱

- Lightweight, which means it does not consume a lot of memory or storage 🚀

- Offline-friendly, which means it can work offline and sync when online 📶

- PDF-friendly, which means it can display any PDF file 📄

- School-friendly, which means it can help find the nearest school or center using GPS. This feature is not fully working yet, as we do not have the location data of all the schools in India 📍

Step to Learn is open source, which means you can access, modify, and contribute to the code on GitHub.
